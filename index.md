I'm a freelance writer focussing on photography, design, and publishing.

I've written about books and zines for [<cite>AIGA Eye on Design</cite>](https://eyeondesign.aiga.org), global landmarks and cultural ephemera for [Google Arts & Culture](https://artsandculture.google.com/), and historic properties for [Inigo](https://inigo.com/almanac). My work has appeared in print for [<cite>The Plant</cite>](https://theplantmagazine.com/), [<cite>Port Magazine</cite>](https://www.port-magazine.com), and [<cite>Above Sea Level</cite>](http://www.above-sea-level.co/). I've also had a couple of letters published in [<cite>VIZ</cite>](https://viz.co.uk/).

I've [coded a few websites](https://github.com/jclwilson), including the [RCA Poster Archive](https://rca-poster-archive.co.uk/), [DKUK](https://dkuk.biz/), [<cite>Paper Journal</cite>](https://paper-journal.com/), and this site.
